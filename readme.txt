Guidelines for using Knights Tour



I used the following:

Host Name: tesla.cs.iupui.edu

Port 22
	


To compile, use: "make"

-> To run, use: "./tour"



(Other Makefile commands)

To clean, use: "make clean"

To debug, use: "make debug"

-> To use debugger, use "gdb ./tour"

-> To run in debugger, use "run" when (gdb) appears



INITIAL POSITION ENTRY MENU:

(1) Add new entry

(2) View current entries

(3) Delete entry

(4) Modify entry

(8) Begin Knights Tour (no Detail)

(9) Begin Knights Tour (w/ Detail)



Using (1) will lead to a prompt of how to add another entry.



Using (2) will display the current entries.



Using (3) will lead to a prompt of how to delete an entry.



Using (4) will lead to a prompt of how to delete an entry, followed by 
a prompt of how to add a new entry.



"Details" in the menu refers to various outputs I programmed so
 I could monitor which move turn the program was on, 
and the values
 of other variables. 



Using (8) will complete the Knights Tour, output a visual representation 
of the solution, and store the answer in the 
array of answers. 



Using (9) will do the same as (8), but will include many extra output
 lines that help the user monitor the progress of 
the program as it
 calculates the path of the knight. This can also be used to prove that
 the stack is used correctly and
the program can backtrack as many spaces 
as needed.

 

Thank you!
